# Simple Blockchain Simulation

## üìå Overview
This project is a simple blockchain simulation built using Python. It demonstrates the fundamental features of a blockchain, including:
- Block structure (index, timestamp, transactions, previous hash, current hash)
- SHA-256 hashing for block integrity
- Proof-of-Work mechanism for mining blocks
- Blockchain validation to detect tampering
